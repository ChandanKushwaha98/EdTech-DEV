        The mission of this series is to take you from Zero to Hero in Data
        Analytics. During this journey, you will learn everything by watching
        videos and then implement it by building projects. The curriculum is
        designed with the principle of `learn by building`, so there will be a
        lot of Assignments/Projects you will work on. So only register if you
        are ready for a grind. After this series, you will be able to prepare
        world class data models, dashboards from scratch. Limited seats.
        Register Now. ✌️
